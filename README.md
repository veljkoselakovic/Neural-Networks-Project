Projects for the NN class

## Project 1
Labelless dataset 
  - Used a shallow NN for a 97% correctness
  - No optimizations
  - Low performance hit for never before seen test sets
  
## Project 2
http://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists - Dataset

Determine if the trainee is ready to leave his workplace based on 11 parameters.
 -Disbalanced dataset
 -Optimizations
  * Regularization
  * Adaptive learning rate
  * Additional weight for the smaller class
  * Grid Search done for some of the parameters, although the high-performance, low-time version
 - 84% Correctness with a 0.3% performance hit on test sets
 - High precision and recall
